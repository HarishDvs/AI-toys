# **AI Learning Toys - Simple AI Problems in Python**

Welcome to the **AI Learning Toys** repository! This project contains simple AI-based puzzles implemented in Python. These problems are great for learning fundamental concepts of problem-solving, algorithms, and artificial intelligence techniques such as search strategies (BFS, DFS), backtracking, and state-space exploration.

## **Problems Included**

1. **Water Jug Problem**  
   - **Objective:** Measure a specific amount of water using two jugs with limited capacities and operations.  
   - **Concepts Used:** Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Depth-First Search (DFS), State-space search.  

2. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**  
   - **Objective:** A simple 3x3 interactive two-player game where the goal is to get three marks in a row.  
   - **Concepts Used:** Game logic, condition checking, user interaction.  

3. **Camel and Banana Problem**  
   - **Objective:** Maximize the number of bananas transported across the desert with constraints on load capacity and consumption.  
   - **Concepts Used:** Greedy algorithm, resource optimization..  

4. **Missionaries and Cannibals Problem**  
   - **Objective:** Safely transport missionaries and cannibals across a river without ever having more cannibals than missionaries on one side.  
   - **Concepts Used:** State-space search, BFS, constraints validation.  

5. **8 Queens Problem**  
   - **Objective:** Place 8 queens on a chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.  
   - **Concepts Used:** Backtracking, recursive search.
